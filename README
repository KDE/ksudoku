KSudoku is a program that can generate and solve sudoku (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)  puzzles (of different difficulty level) using a randomized least-candidate algorithm.
From version 0.3 i added a new kind of puzzles: 3d puzzles. (see changelog)
The sudoku boards currently supported are 9x9, 16x16, 25x25: but the program is fully expandable since the algorithm is extendible to any general graph coloring problem (the board is in fact stored as a graph and the numbers are the colors) 
In order to create a playable puzzle it fills a blank sudoku grid with a completed puzzle (randomly), then another algorithm (to be improved with some logical constraint) removes randomly numbers from it checking each time that the resultant puzzle has only one solution: it is a bit slower than logic-based elimination tecniques but it creates puzzles that are less straight-solved (more fun).
The GUI is user-friendly and requires KDE and opengl.
Written in C++.

REQUIREMENTS :
	- open gl library (also header files)  - mesa3d.org
	- glu library (also header files) - mesa3d.org
	- kde headers and libs

INSTALLATION

1. Open a shell in project directory (the one where this file is located)
2. Ectract project tar -xvvzf ksudoku-0.3.tar.gz
2. Run "./configure --prefix=`kdeconfig --prefix`"
(will install the program in /usr/local/kde, if you want to install in /usr run "./configure --prefix=/usr")
3. Run "make"
4. Run "make install" as root.
5. Run "ksudoku" (if does not start check point 2)


CHANGE LOG 0.3

- Now it supports 3d puzzles (totally new!!)
- Open gl (qtglwidget) engine
- 3d puzzles supported 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5 (hard)
- Now it generates also simmetric puzzles
- You can choose puzzle's simmetry type (random, diagonal, central, 4-way, none)
- Fixed "Solve bug"
- Tracker can be hidden
- Rip function improved
- Support for 25x25 puzzles (625 numbers to place!)
- Faster
- Faster Checkpoint use: added shortcuts CTRL+A CTRL+E 

CHANGE LOG 0.2

- New Icon (by sheepzilla)
- Added click-and-write superscript mode (RMB then write number) (idea from dovidhalevi (David Baron) suggestion)
- Algorithm optimized
- All puzzles allows only 1 solution, in 0.1 Hardest lavel could have multiple ones.
- Timer function
- Highlight function (fast number place locator) PRESS SHIFT during gameplay TRY IT
- Font sizes fixed (idea from dovidhalevi (David Baron) suggestion)
- New colors
- Checkpoint stack(save & resume)
- Status bar with current selected number indicator and hints (idea from Isma (Ismael Asensio) suggestion)
- Now you can choose if you want computer to show red your errors during gameplay (idea from Isma (Ismael Asensio) suggestion)
