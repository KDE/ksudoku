/**
 * @class SudokuBoard  sudokuboard.h
 * @short Generalized data-structures and methods for handling Sudoku puzzles.
 *
 * SudokuBoard is an abstract class for handling several types of Sudoku puzzle,
 * including the classic 9x9 Sudoku, other sizes of the classic Sudoku, the
 * XSudoku and Jigsaw variants, Samurai Sudoku (with five overlapping grids)
 * and the three-dimensional Roxdoku.
 *
 * The class is an adaptation of algorithms in a Python program, Copyright (c)
 * David Bau 2006, which appears at http://davidbau.com/downloads/sudoku.py and
 * is discussed at http://davidbau.com/archives/2006/09/04/sudoku_generator.html
 * 
 * A puzzle, its solution and the intermediate steps in solution are represented
 * as vectors of integer cells (type BoardContents), in which a cell can contain
 * zero if it is yet to be solved, -1 if it is not used (e.g. the gaps between
 * the five overlapping grids of a Samurai Sudoku) or an integer greater than
 * zero if it is a given (or clue) or has been (tentatively) solved.
 *
 * The central method of the class is the solver (solve()). It is used when
 * solving an existing puzzle, generating a puzzle, checking the validity of a
 * puzzle keyed in or loaded from a file, verifying that a puzzle is solvable,
 * checking that it has only one solution and collecting statistics related to
 * the difficulty of solving the puzzle.
 *
 * Puzzle generation begins by using the solver to fill a mainly empty board and
 * thus create the solution.  The next step is to insert values from the
 * solution into another empty board until there are enough to solve the puzzle
 * without any guessing (i.e. by logic alone).  If the difficulty of the puzzle
 * is now as required, puzzle generation finishes.  It it is too hard, a few
 * more values are inserted and then puzzle generation finishes.
 *
 * If the puzzle is not yet hard enough, some of the values are removed at
 * random until the puzzle becomes insoluble if any more cells are removed or
 * the puzzle has more than one solution or the required level of difficulty
 * is reached.  If the puzzle is still not hard enough after all random removals
 * have been tried, the whole puzzle-generation process is repeated until the
 * required difficulty is reached or a limit is exceeded.
 *
 * The principal methods used in puzzle-generation are generatePuzzle(),
 * insertValues(), removeValues() and checkPuzzle().  The checkPuzzle() method
 * is also used to check the validity of a puzzle entered manually or loaded
 * from a file.  The virtual methods clear() and fillBoard() clear a board or
 * fill it with randomly chosen values (the solution).
 *
 * IDW TODO - Rewrite this.
 * The main input to the puzzle generator/solver is an pointer to an object of
 * type SKGraph.  That object contains the shape, dimensions and rules for
 * grouping the cells of the particular type of Sudoku being played, including
 * Classic Sudoku in several sizes and variants, Samurai Sudoku with five
 * overlapping grids and the three-dimensional Roxdoku in several sizes.
 *
 * Each group (row, column, blocki or plane) contains N cells in which the
 * numbers * 1 to N must appear exactly once.  N can be 4, 9, 16 or 25, but not
 * all types of puzzle support all four sizes.
 *
 * As examples, a classic Sudoku puzzle has 27 groups: 9 rows, 9 columns and
 * 9 blocks of 3x3 cells.  Each group must contain the numbers 1 to 9 once and
 * only once.  An XSudoku puzzle has two extra groups of 9 cells each on the
 * board's diagonals.  A Samurai puzzle has five overlapping 9x9 grids, with 45
 * columns, 45 rows and 41 blocks of 3x3 cells, making 131 groups in all.  A
 * classic Sudoku puzzle of size 16 has 16 rows, 16 columns and 16 blocks of
 * 4x4 cells, making 48 groups, where each group must contain the values 1 to
 * 16 once and only once.  A 3x3x3 Roxdoku puzzle is a cube with 9 groups of
 * 3x3 cells.  These form 3 planes perpendicular to each of the X, Y and Z axes.
 *
 * All these configurations are represented by a table of groups (or cliques) in
 * the SKGraph object, which maps cell numbers into groups.  The SudokuBoard
 * class itself is unaware of the type of puzzle it is generating or solving.
