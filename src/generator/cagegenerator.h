/**
 * This class and its methods do all the work of generating a Mathdoku or
 * Killer Sudoku puzzle, starting from a solved set of cell-values in a Sudoku
 * grid. It lays down a pattern of irregular shaped cages, of different sizes,
 * which together cover the grid. Cages of size 1 have only one possible
 * solution, so they act as givens or clues. Cages of larger size are given an
 * operator (+*-/) and a target value. In the solution, the values in each cage
 * must combine together, using the operator, to equal the target value. Finally
 * the puzzle, represented by the targets, the operators and the single cells,
 * must have a unique solution. The DLX solver tests this. If there is no unique
 * solution, the puzzle must be rejected and the user of this class will need to
 * try again.
 *
 * In Killer Sudoku, the only operator is +, there are there are square boxes
 * (as well as rows and columns) that must satisfy Sudoku rules and a cage
 * cannot contain the same digit more than once.
 *
 * In Mathdoku (aka KenKen TM), all four operators can occur, a digit can occur
 * more than once in a cage and Sudoku rules apply only to rows and columns. The
 * latter means that a Mathdoku puzzle can have any size from 3x3 up to 9x9.
 * Division and subtraction operators are a special case. They can only appear
 * in cages of size 2. This is because the order in which you do divisions or
 * subtractions, in a cage of size 3 or more, can affect the result. 6 - (4 - 1)
 * = 3, but (6 - 4) - 1 = 1.
