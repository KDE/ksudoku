 * @class DLXSolver dlxsolver.h
 * @short Provides a solver, based on the DLX algorithm, for Sudoku variants.
 *
 * This solver can handle all variants of Sudoku puzzles supported by KSudoku,
 * including classical 9x9 Sudokus, 2-D variants, 3-D variants, Killer Sudoku
 * and MathDoku (aka KenKen TM).
 *
 * Killer and MathDoku puzzles have cages in which all the numbers must satisfy
 * an arithmetic constraint, as well as satisfying the usual Sudoku constraints
 * (using all numbers exactly once each in a column, row or group).  Killer
 * Sudokus have 9x9 cells and nine 3x3 boxes, but there are no clues and each
 * cage must add up to a prescribed total.  MathDokus can have N x N cells, for
 * N >= 3, but no boxes.  Each cage has an operator (+, -, multiply or divide)
 * which must be used to reach the required value.  In Killers and Mathdokus, a
 * cage with just one cell is effectively a clue.
 *
 * The DLX algorithm (aka Dancing Links) is due to Donald Knuth.

    /** 
     * Takes any of the various kinds of 2-D Sudoku or 3-D Roxdoku puzzle
     * supported by the KSudoku application program and converts it into a
     * sparse matrix of constraints and possible solution values for each
     * vacant cell. It then calls the solveDLX method to solve the puzzle,
     * using Donald Knuth's Dancing Links (DLX) algorithm. The algorithm can
     * find zero, one or any number of solutions, each of which can converted
     * back into a KSudoku grid containing a solution.
     *
     * Each column in the DLX matrix represents a constraint that must be
     * satisfied. In a Classic 9x9 Sudoku, there are 81 constraints to say that
     * each cell must be filled in exactly once. Then there are 9x9 constraints
     * to say that each of the 9 Sudoku columns must contain the numbers 1 to 9 
     * exactly once. Similarly for the 9 Sudoku rows and the 9 3x3 boxes. In
     * total, there are 81 + 9x9 + 9x9 + 9x9 = 324 constraints and so there are
     * 324 columns in the DLX matrix.
     *
     * Each row in the DLX matrix represents a position in the Sudoku grid and
     * a value (1 to 9) that might go there. If it does, it will satisfy 4 of
     * the constraints: filling in a cell and putting that value in a column, a
     * row and a 3x3 box. That possibility is represented by a 1 in that row in
     * each of the corresponding constraint columns. Thus there are 4 ones in
     * each row of the 9x9 Sudoku's DLX matrix and in total there 9x81 = 729
     * rows, representing a possible 1 to 9 in each of 81 cells.
     *
     * A solution to the 9x9 Sudoku will consist of a set of 81 rows such that
     * each column contains a single 1. That means that each constraint is
     * satisfied exactly once, as required by the rules of Sudoku. Each of the
     * successful 81 rows will still contain its original four 1's, representing
     * the constraints the corresponding Sudoku cell and value satisfies.
     *
     * Applying clues reduces the rows to be found by whatever the number of
     * clues is --- and it also reduces the size of the DLX matrix considerably.
     * For example, for a 9x9 Classic Sudoku, the size can reduce from 729x324
     * to 224x228 or even less. Furthermore, many of the remaining columns
     * contain a single 1 already, so the solution becomes quite fast.
     *
     * KSudoku can handle other sizes and shapes of Sudoku puzzle, including the
     * 3-D Roxdoku puzzles. For example, an XSudoku is like a Classic 9x9 puzzle
     * except that the two diagonals must each contain the numbers 1 to 9 once
     * and once only. In DLX, this can be represented by 18 additional columns
     * to represent the constraints on the diagonals. Also a group of 9 cells
     * might not have a simple row, column or 3x3 box shape, as in a jigsaw
     * type of Sudoku or a 3-D Roxdoku, and a Samurai Sudoku has five 9x9
     * grids overlapping inside a 21x21 array of cells, some of which must NOT
     * be used. All this is represented by lists of cells in the SKGraph object,
     * known as "cliques" or "groups". So, in the more general case, each group
     * of 9 cells will have its own 9 constraints or DLX matrix columns.
     *
     * @param graph          An SKGraph object representing the size, geometric
     *                       layout and rules of the particular kind of puzzle.
     * @param boardValues    A vector containing clue values, vacant cells and
     *                       unused values for the puzzle and its layout.
     * @param solutionLimit  A limit to the number of solutions to be delivered
     *                       where 0 = no limit, 1 gets the first solution only
     *                       and 2 is used to test if there is > 1 solution.
     *
     * @return               The number of solutions found (0 to solutionLimit).
