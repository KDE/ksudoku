<para>&ksudoku; is a logic-based symbol placement puzzle.</para>

<para>The player has to fill a grid with symbols so that each column, row
	and block on the game board contains only one instance of each
	symbol. In &ksudoku; the symbols are usually the numbers 1 to 9,
	but may be the letters A to P or A to Y in larger puzzles. Puzzles
	start with the board partially filled and it is your job to fill
	in the rest. Some types of puzzle have less than nine symbols.</para>

<para>When you start a game, you can choose from several Sudoku types
	and sizes. You can then have &ksudoku; generate a puzzle for
	you to solve or you can start with an empty board and enter in
	a puzzle from another source, such as a newspaper, then get
	&ksudoku; to check it and maybe solve it.</para>

<para>There are many variations of Sudoku in existence and &ksudoku;
	provides a good selection of them. The most common type, Standard Sudoku, has
	a 9x9 square grid and uses Arabic numerals 1 to 9 as symbols. The
	grid has 9 rows and 9 columns and is divided into 9 blocks of
	3x3 squares. The problem is â€“ each symbol can only be used once
	per row, column or block.</para>

	<note><para>
		It takes time and concentration to complete a game. However,
		solving Sudoku puzzles helps to increase overall brain activity
		and therefore is highly recommended.</para></note>
</chapter>

<chapter id="howto"><title>How to Play</title> <!-- do not change this! -->

	<note><title>Objective:</title><para>
		Fill the grid so that each column, row and block contains only
		one instance of each symbol.</para></note>

<para>When the game starts you are prompted to choose which game type and board
	size you are interested in. You can enter in a puzzle from another
	source or have &ksudoku; generate a puzzle. The generator has several
	difficulty settings and some symmetry settings, which affect
	the pattern in which the puzzle is generated. Your game experience will
	depend on which of all these options you choose.</para>

<para>When the puzzle board appears, take a look at the left hand side. There
	is a selection list which contains all the symbols available in the
	current game. The set of symbols depends on the size of game you
	choose. Games may have 4, 9, 16 or 25 symbols. The first two sets
	use the numbers 1 to 4 or 1 to 9: the others use the letters A to P
	or A to Y.</para>

<para>First, note the boundaries in the game board. The thick lines outline
	the blocks. Each of these blocks has to be completed using the symbols
	available and each symbol must be used once and only once within the
	block. The same is true of the rows and columns in the board.</para>

<para>Now you can start entering symbols into the vacant squares on the board.
	To do that, select the symbol you wish to enter from the selection
	list on the left, then use the mouse to click on a vacant square
	in the board. Alternatively, you can hover with the mouse over a
	vacant square or use the cursor keys to move around,
    then use the keyboard to enter a symbol.</para>

<para>In Roxdoku (three-dimensional) puzzles, always use the mouse to set a
	small cube to a value and use a <emphasis>double</emphasis>
	click. When you rotate the large cube, by clicking and dragging
	with the mouse, it is easier to see what values are on the small
	cubes in the background if you click <emphasis>between</emphasis>
	the small cubes, not on them.</para>

<para>It is useful sometimes to enter markers or notes, which are tiny
	symbols within a square. These have no influence on the solution,
	but they can help you keep track of ideas you have had, especially
	when there is a choice between two alternatives and you do not
	yet have enough information to decide between them. To enter a
	marker or note, click with the &RMB; or hold down the &Shift; key
    when using the keyboard.</para>

<para>To clear symbols from a square, hover over the square with the
	mouse and hit &Del; or &Backspace; on the keyboard or click with
    the &RMB; on the square.</para>

<para>Notice that the squares change color while you hover the mouse over
	them. This is to help you keep up with the rules of &ksudoku;. Use
	the vertical and horizontal lines to check if the symbol you are
	about to enter into a vacant spot is already in use anywhere in
	the vertical or horizontal line that square is a part of. The coloring
	also highlights the block which, if you remember, must also contain
	only one instance of each symbol. If you do not need the highlighting,
	you can use the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
	<guimenuitem>Configure &ksudoku;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
	menu item to turn it off.</para>

<para>Keep entering symbols in accordance with the rules until the whole
	game field is filled up. At this point &ksudoku; will check if all
	the entries are valid and will either correct you or accept your
	solution.</para>

<sect2 id="killer"><title>Killer and Mathdoku Variations</title>

	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Killer puzzles have two variants: Tiny Killer 
		(4x4) and Killer Sudoku (9x9). They both have rows, columns 
		and square blocks, exactly as in Standard Sudoku puzzles 
		and following exactly the same rules. They also have 
		irregularly shaped areas called cages, where each cage's 
		digits must add up to the number in small type in the 
		corner of the cage and no digit can be repeated within 
		the cage. Typically the puzzle starts with only a few 
		squares containing symbols. You need to use arithmetic 
		and the usual Sudoku rules together to work out the 
		solution. The screen graphics make it difficult to 
		visualize the square blocks that are present, but they 
		are easier to see if you print the puzzle, using the 
		<menuchoice><guimenu>Game</guimenu>
		<guimenuitem>Print...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
		menu item.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Mathdoku variants, also known as 
                <trademark>Kenken</trademark>, have no blocks, only row and 
		column restrictions, and have cages where the digits 
		must add, subtract, divide or multiply according to the 
		values and arithmetical symbols in small type in their 
		corners. A digit in a Mathdoku cage can be repeated, 
		but not in the same column or row. For example, an 
		L-shape of three squares with a requirement 5+ can have 
		solutions 1 3 1 or 2 1 2, provided the ones or twos are 
		not in the same row or column as each other. Note that 
		subtraction and division cages always have two squares 
		and the two digits of the solution can appear in either 
		order. For example, a 2-cage could have solutions 1 3 
		or 3 1 or 2 4 or 4 2, &etc;</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Because there are no blocks in a Mathdoku puzzle, 
		it can have any size from 3x3 up to 9x9, with the default 
		being 6x6. See the
		<link linkend="configuration">Game Configuration</link> 
		section for details. To get you started, there is 
		a variant called Mathdoku 101 of size 4x4.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Use marker moves when you spot a square or

	<listitem><para>If you are having trouble, try to retrace your

	<listitem><para>Even though &ksudoku; provides a 'Hint' option

<chapter id="interface"><title>Interface Overview</title> <!-- do not change this! -->

<sect1 id="welcome-screen"><title>The Welcome Screen</title>

<para>The Welcome Screen is the first thing you see when you start
	&ksudoku; or use the toolbar or menu to request a new game.
	It has a list of all the puzzle types and sizes and you can
	click on one of them to make a selection.</para>

<para>If you click the button marked <guibutton>Enter In A Puzzle</guibutton>, an empty board
	of the selected type and size appears. Here you can use the mouse
	or keyboard to enter in a puzzle from another source, such as
	a newspaper. When you have finished, use the <guilabel>Check</guilabel> action, on
	toolbar or menu, to check the puzzle. It should have just one
	solution. If so, you can start solving the puzzle or perhaps
	get &ksudoku; to solve it. If there is no solution or more
	than one solution, it probably means you have made a data-entry
	error somewhere.</para>

<para>If you click the button marked <guibutton>Generate A Puzzle</guibutton>, &ksudoku;
	will display a board with some squares already filled in. It
	is up to you to fill in the rest.</para>

<para>Before you generate a puzzle, check that the settings of the
	<guilabel>Difficulty:</guilabel> and <guilabel>Symmetry:</guilabel>
	drop down boxes are to your liking. You can change them during a game, but
	then they will have no effect until the next puzzle is
	generated.</para>

	<note><para>If you cannot see the <guilabel>Difficulty:</guilabel> and <guilabel>Symmetry:</guilabel>
		drop down boxes, use the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
		<guimenuitem>Show Statusbar</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
		menu item to make sure that the statusbar is
		visible.</para></note>

<para>The <guilabel>Difficulty:</guilabel> drop down box provides six levels of difficulty, from
	<guimenuitem>Very Easy</guimenuitem> up to <guimenuitem>Hard</guimenuitem>,
	<guimenuitem>Diabolical</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Unlimited</guimenuitem>. The easier
	levels may take a few minutes to solve on a 9x9 board. The
	<guimenuitem>Hard</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Diabolical</guimenuitem> levels may take an hour or so and are
	intended to be equivalent to difficult grades appearing in
	newspapers. Samurai puzzles and 16x16 or 25x25 sizes of
	puzzles will take longer to solve, simply because there are
	more rows, columns and blocks and more squares to fill in.</para>

<para>The <guimenuitem>Diabolical</guimenuitem> level typically requires one or more guesses,
	with backtracking if you guess wrong. Lower levels can usually
	be solved by logic alone. The <guimenuitem>Unlimited</guimenuitem> level has no limits
	on the number of guesses required, how soon the first guess
	is needed or how complex the logic might be. It is provided
	for the interest of expert players, but tends to generate
    uninteresting <quote>inhuman</quote> puzzles and is not recommended
    for general use.</para>

 <para>The <guilabel>Symmetry:</guilabel> drop down box provides seven types of symmetry, including
	<guimenuitem>No Symmetry</guimenuitem>. This controls the layout and appearance of the
	squares that are filled in at the start of a puzzle and has
	mainly aesthetic effect, except that puzzles with no symmetry
	tend to be slightly harder than those with high symmetry and
	it is less likely that &ksudoku; can generate a puzzle with
	high difficulty and high symmetry combined.</para>
